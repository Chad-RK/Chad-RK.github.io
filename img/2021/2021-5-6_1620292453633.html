        <p>A lemur character I made. I planned to make a slob edit (and make him more visibly overstuffed) but around the time this was drawn I got a second job and shortly afterwards became depressed. Yay!</p>
        <p>I'm a contract worker now and am not depressed so I can go back to making fat kink porn, but I don't feel like working on this old piece any further.</p>
        <p>All you need to know about the pic is this guy's backstory is his girlfriend left him and now he eats to forget and now he's a big fat fuck. I think the fact I was interested in drawing him is a good indicator of where I was at this time in my life. I still like the "depressed reluctant gainer" thing and this is definitely the hardest I've worked on a piece, so it's still something worth sharing.</p>
