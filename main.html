        <p>Chad is an alias that I use when posting adult content on the internet. This is the gallery for that alias.</p>
        <p>Content in this gallery is provided at the original exported resolutions. All images use lossless PNG compression, often exported directly from Krita.</p>
        <p>Content on this website is licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license</a>. You are free to redistribute and edit it as long as you provide proper attribution (say you got it from here), make sure you don't profit off of the work in any way, and anything you make based on my work should also be BY-NC-SA 4.0 (or similar). If you want to license the content for a commercial project, let me know and we can talk it out.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Each item in the gallery uses labeled, color-coded bars to denote what content warnings preceed them. If you have JavaScript enabled (most people do) you can click the items in the legend below to hide or show this content. Hidden items will be shown as an empty space as though an item should be there, but their content warning markers will still be visible so you know why it is hidden. Some content is off by default.</p>
        <p>If an item is labeled "[x] variant(s)" where x is a number, then there are alternative versions of this image available. <strong>These variants may contain alternative kinks with more extreme content. They are clearly labeled if that is the case.</strong> Proceed with discretion.</p>
        <p>If an item is labeled "[x] in sequence", then there are multiple images provided in the link.</p>
        <p>Hover over an item in the legend for a more detailed description of the marked content.</p>
